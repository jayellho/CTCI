This code repository is intended to assist readers of 'Cracking the Coding Interview' (by Gayle Laakmann) by helping to create a skeleton directory (by chapter) for their practice. It will also include my code as I follow the book chapter by chapter.  

The skeleton directory would include the following:  
1. .py files for each question in the chapter. This will run through the user-defined test cases and output the number of passed test cases.
2. .txt file for user-defined test cases.

# How to use
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal and run 'python create_skeleton_dir_by_chapter'.
3. Follow the prompts from the code to create your skeleton directory by chapter.
4. Edit the .py to include your code for each question.
5. Include relevant test cases as necessary in the .txt.
